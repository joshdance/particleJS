Change log for ParticleJS
-------------------------

0.1.3 ALPHA

ADD: Preliminary grid based turbulence physics with custom resolution (perlin noise implemented, todo: vortex)
CHG: Physics is changed to separate plugins. Each physic model is created separately (wind, magnet, gravity etc.)
     and added to emitter via addPhysics in the order needed. Each physics plugin has its own methods for
     adjustments. This adds major flexibility with very little additional performance cost.


0.1.2 ALPHA

IMP: performance improvements
CHG: emitter must be created manually, then added using same method as before
ADD: Magnet force (initial behavior, will most likely morph into a different effect
     and replaced with a more realistic behavior).
ADD: translate() to emitter to move emitter and all particles incl. old
     (as moving emitter alone won't affect old particles).


0.1.1 ALPHA

CHG: scene.addEmitter() returns a reference for the created emitter
CHG: Speed improvements in renderer using scaled cache
ADD: Support for variable feather size (random based on %)
ADD: Common function for calculating random spread
ADD: Improved "GC" of empty arrays
ADD: method on emitter to set render
FIX: Various minor bugs in ranges


0.1.0 ALPHA

Initial release
