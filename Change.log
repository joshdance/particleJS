Change log for ParticleJS
-------------------------

0.1.7 ALPHA

ADD: Option to use image to clear background when enabling pre-render for shader (option: image).


0.1.6 ALPHA

ADD: DEMO: snow
ADD: DEMO: fireworks
ADD: DEMO: Audio visualizer (newer Chrome or Firefox) (the music track used here is freely distributable btw)
ADD: "blur" clear now supports transparency (shader option with clearOpacity: keepAlpha (bool)).
ADD: added method to scene to render without generating particles. This allow manual generation directly from the emitter (see audio demo).
ADD: three new emitter types: line, box, grid in addition to point
ADD: common map object for physics engine
ADD: starting (slowly) jsdoc implementation
ADD: random color support (over life with gradient)
ADD: max particles option for emitter
CHG: LICENSE CHANGE
CHG: emitter option spreadAngle->spreadOffset, spread->spreadAngle
CHG: Changed particles internal array from 2D to 1D
CHG: Vortex plugin uses new map object
CHG: simplified namespace (turbulence.noise->turbulence, turbulence.vortex->vortex, Emitter2D.Point->Emitter2D).
CHG: moving air-resistance from wind -> gravity
FIX: gradient in shader referenced parent context by accident instead of local ref.

0.1.5 ALPHA

ADD: Enable reverse z-order for rendering
ADD: New globalForce method on emitter affecting the end velocity
ADD: Z-depth animate-able turbulence with jitter-array
ADD: methods to turbulence plugins
CHG: wind plugin rewritten to support map for wave effect
CHG: vortex plugin now caches angle maps
CHG: renaming renderer -> shader
CHG: emitter.setShader() (was: setRenderer()) is now async capable
CHG: merging init() and setup() for shader -> init() only (internal)
CHG: feather value uses normalized values [0.0, 1.0] instead of %
CHG: variation values uses normalized values [0.0, 1.0] instead of %
CHG: Turbulence tools and plugins: getMap() -> getMapImage().
FIX: misc. optimizations and fixes

0.1.4 ALPHA

ADD: Added 3D version of SimplexNoise (Perlin noise) for animation. Will
     replace 2D version (patent issues with 3D impl. being checked).
ADD: Vortex physics plugin. Supports suction/repulsion, gradient radial
     force. Chain several to create multiple vortex fields.
CHG: Vortex replaces magnet (set suction to 1.0)
CHG: Initialization of physics plugins is now asynchronous. Callback is
     optional though and is only needed where the plugin itself require
     asynchronous setup (ie. web workers etc.). Will let this live a
     while and see if need changes.
CHG: Centralized time-compensation value so it's only calculated once.
     Each physics plugin now calculates wo/ needing to know the comp.
CHG: Physics plugin's init() now gets an object passed in instead of
     width and height parameters.
CHG: Optimized and fixed a bug in the 3D SimplexNoise implementation.
CHG: Conceptual change for feather. Is now percentage of max possible feather.


0.1.3 ALPHA

ADD: Preliminary grid based turbulence physics with custom resolution
     (SimplexNoise (Perlin based noise) implemented)
CHG: Physics is changed to separate plugins. Each physic model is
     created separately (wind, magnet, gravity etc.) and added to
     emitter via addPhysics in the order needed. Each physics plugin has
     its own methods for adjustments. This adds major flexibility with
     very little additional performance cost.


0.1.2 ALPHA

IMP: performance improvements
CHG: emitter must be created manually, then added using same method as
     before
ADD: Magnet force (initial behavior, will most likely morph into a
     different effect and replaced with a more realistic behavior).
ADD: translate() to emitter to move emitter and all particles incl. old
     (as moving emitter alone won't affect old particles).


0.1.1 ALPHA

CHG: scene.addEmitter() returns a reference for the created emitter
CHG: Speed improvements in renderer using scaled cache
ADD: Support for variable feather size (random based on %)
ADD: Common function for calculating random spread
ADD: Improved "GC" of empty arrays
ADD: method on emitter to set render
FIX: Various minor bugs in ranges


0.1.0 ALPHA

Initial release
