Change log for ParticleJS
-------------------------

0.1.2 ALPHA

IMP: performance improvements
CHG: emitter must be created manually, then added using same method as before
ADD: Magnet force (initial behavior, will most likely morph into a different effect
     and replaced with a more realistic behavior).
ADD: translate() to emitter to move emitter and all particles incl. old
     (as moving emitter alone won't affect old particles).

0.1.1 ALPHA

CHG: scene.addEmitter() returns a reference for the created emitter
CHG: Speed improvements in renderer using scaled cache
ADD: Support for variable feather size (random based on %)
ADD: Common function for calculating random spread
ADD: Improved "GC" of empty arrays
ADD: method on emitter to set render
FIX: Various minor bugs in ranges
