{"name":"Particlejs","tagline":"Real-time particle engine for JavaScript","body":"﻿ParticleJS\r\n==========\r\n\r\n**ParticleJS is a real-time particle engine for JavaScript** and typically canvas,\r\nalthough not limited to.\r\n\r\nWith this particle engine you can make real-time effects such as smoke, flames, dust, clouds\r\nand explosions. You can also create fluids and ambient effects. As it uses\r\na plugin model for rendering and physics you can render a particle in unlimited ways.\r\n\r\nThe engine is for real-time use, but still very early work in progress.\r\n\r\n**This ALPHA version has implemented:**\r\n\r\n- Plugin based render engine (incl. for 2D canvas)\r\n- Plugin based physics engine (wind, gravity, turbulence, vortex etc.)\r\n- Render plugins can be defined to support various particle shapes and render surfaces\r\n- Opacity, and opacity over-life for each individual particle\r\n- Feather, and feather over-life for each individual particle\r\n- Size, and size over-life for each individual particle\r\n- Solid color, or color gradient for over-life change for each individual particle\r\n- Flexible over-life arrays can be of any length and engine will adopt\r\n- Particles per second birth rate\r\n- Velocity rate\r\n- Spread angle (z axis only for now which means it only spreads along x and y)\r\n- Spread angle offset\r\n- Random variations and amount of it for velocity, size, feather and opacity at birth\r\n- Time or frame bound (latter intended for rendering frames). Will adopt to current frame rate providing\r\nas smooth as possible animation.\r\n- Render engine supports pre-, post- and update render calls per emitter for renderer (this allow you to share drawing surface).\r\n- Automatic clean-up of dead particles and particle arrays\r\n- Z-order toggle (newest or oldest first)\r\n- Global force parameter\r\n- Animated turbulence\r\n\r\n**In progress / evaluated:**\r\n\r\n- Centralized sprite caching for 2D bitmap surfaces\r\n- Z-axis support (2.5D)\r\n- Additional velocity parameters\r\n- Improve air resistance of physics wind engine\r\n- A High-Quality mode if user wants to render frames in a no real-time scenario\r\n\r\n**MAYBE... and most likely only for a web-gl renderer:**\r\n\r\n- Scene with 3D light and camera support\r\n- 3D Particles (in addition to the 2.5D above)\r\n- Shaders to render particles with light and shadow\r\n- Visual editor to create curves for \"over-life\" features, and:\r\n- Visual editor to setup an emitter and particles, and to generate code for it\r\n\r\n![Snow demo](http://i.imgur.com/P3BMlXq.png)<br>\r\n<sup>Realistic snow can be simulated (see demo)</sup>\r\n\r\n![Fireworks demo](http://i.imgur.com/UvcffGW.png)<br>\r\n<sup>Fireworks demo. Wind resistance not yet supported but still good results (see demo)</sup>\r\n\r\n![Audio vizualizer](http://i.imgur.com/8wEs64h.png)<br>\r\n<sup>A simple audio visualizer using FFT analysis to drive the single particle line emitter</sup>\r\n\r\n![snapshot 1](http://i.imgur.com/H4DvC13.png)<br>\r\n<sup>200 particles/s @ 2.8s life, gradient, turbulence, 2x vortexes, magnet (also vortex based ) opacity and size over life @ 60 FPS</sup>\r\n\r\n![snapshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/RosB7NO.png)<br>\r\n<sup>Visual representation of the turbulence grid from the turbulence noise physics plugin</sup>\r\n\r\n![snapshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/sbAbNwR.png)<br>\r\n<sup>Single vortex map representation with gradient radial force mapping and suction. Several can be combined.</sup>\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMore details will be published when it goes to beta. Nothing is 100%\r\nsettled yet as some tweaks and changes may have to be made to keep it\r\nable to run real-time.\r\n\r\nPlease see included demo and play around with the parameters in the source.\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n------\r\n\r\nThere are known issues. As the engine is in alpha there is no need at this point to\r\nreport issues as things change fast and we may add/remove features and so forth for\r\nthe next version.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nDual license:\r\n\r\n- Free license for personal and non-commercial use.
